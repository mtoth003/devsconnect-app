devs<em>Connect</em>

This application was built using a React frontend with a Ruby/Sinatra backend. The purpose of devConnect is to serve as a platform for web developers to share significant and useful programming content from blogs to tutorials to cool YouTube demos. Upon login or signup, the user gains access to their personal devConnect account. From 'My Feed', the user can view posts from all others users with the ability to filter by desired topics. From 'My Page', the user can view all of their own posts, update their account information such as Github and LinkedIn, or create a new post. Users have the ability to favorite both their own and others' posts for persistent viewing under 'My Favorites'.
